# Stealth: Advanced Network Cloaking Engine

**Version:** 0.1.0
**Status:** Development

## üß† High-Level Vision

Stealth is an advanced, modular, terminal-based network-cloaking engine designed for robust privacy and dynamic network presence. It provides continuous IP address morphing, packet interception and modification capabilities, a real-time terminal dashboard, and a REST API for third-party integration.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Continuous IP Morphing:** Automatically changes the host's IP address at user-defined intervals. Integrates with proxies/VPNs.
* **Packet Interception & Modification (Core C components):** Captures outgoing packets, allowing for header rewriting and payload metadata adjustments for enhanced stealth (requires `libnetfilter_queue` on Linux).
* **Signal Shifting (Core C++ component):** Implements frequency-jitter algorithms to break predictable traffic patterns, aiming to defeat some forms of traffic analysis.
* **REST API:** Auto-generates a REST API on each run (if enabled) for controlling Stealth and retrieving status/logs. Supports API key authentication.
* **Flag-Driven CLI:** A comprehensive Bash-based CLI (`stealth.sh`) to control all aspects of the engine (interval, proxy, verbose mode, API launch, ghost mode, etc.).
* **Live Terminal Dashboard (Python + Rich):** Renders a full-screen, color-coded terminal dashboard displaying real-time events, IP changes, connection attempts (simulated/logged), errors, and system status.
* **Ghost Mode (`--ghost`):** An ultra-stealth mode that disables *all* disk-based logging (both text and JSON), leaving zero trace of Stealth's operational logs on the host system for the current session.
* **Dual Logging (Default Mode):**
    * `logs/stealth.json`: Structured JSON logs for easy parsing and potential use in web dashboards.
    * `logs/stealth.log`: Classic append-only text logs for human readability.
* **One-Step Installer (`install_stealth.sh`):** A Bash script to bootstrap dependencies, compile core C/C++ modules, set up the Python virtual environment, and optionally configure a systemd service for auto-start.
* **Multi-Language Modularity:** Core components in C/C++, API in Python (FastAPI), CLI in Bash, UI in Python (Rich). Optional API implementations in Go and Node.js are provided as placeholders.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Stealth is built with a modular, multi-language architecture:

* **Core Engine (C/C++):**
    * Located in `core/`.
    * **C Modules (`core/c`):** Handles low-level network operations like IP morphing (conceptual, OS-dependent) using raw sockets/libpcap (conceptual) and packet interception using `libnetfilter_queue` (Linux-specific).
    * **C++ Modules (`core/cpp`):** Provides higher-level logic such as signal shifting algorithms and the core logging interface (`logger.cpp` providing a C-compatible interface via `logger_interface.h`).
    * Compiled using CMake (`core/cpp/CMakeLists.txt`).
* **REST API Layer (`api/`):**
    * **Python (FastAPI) (`api/python`):** Primary API implementation providing endpoints for `/start`, `/status`, `/logs`, `/config`, and `/rotate_ip_now`. Uses Uvicorn for serving.
    * **Go & Node.js (`api/go`, `api/js`):** Placeholder implementations for alternative high-performance or ecosystem-specific API servers.
* **Command-Line Interface (`cli/`):**
    * **Bash (`stealth.sh`):** The main entry point. Parses flags (using `flags.sh`) and orchestrates the core engine and API. Uses utility functions from `utils.sh`.
* **User Interface (`ui/`):**
    * **Python Terminal UI (`ui/python`):** A Rich-based, full-screen live dashboard (`terminal_ui.py`) with styling from `style_config.py`.
    * **Web Dashboard (Placeholder) (`ui/js`):** Basic structure for a future web-based dashboard.
* **Logging System (`logging/`):**
    * **Python JSON Logger (`json_logger.py`):** A script to append structured events to `logs/stealth.json`, designed for robustness with file locking.
    * **C++ Classic Log Writer (`log_writer.cpp`):** A simpler, alternative C++ text log writer. The primary C/C++ text logging is handled by `core/cpp/logger.cpp`.
    * **Schema (`logging/schemas/event_schema.json`):** Defines the structure for JSON log entries.
* **Installer (`installer/`):**
    * **Bash Script (`install_stealth.sh`):** Automates the setup process.
    * **Post-Install Guide (`post_install.md`):** Provides additional setup and troubleshooting information.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Linux (recommended, especially for packet interception features).
* Build tools: `gcc/g++`, `cmake`, `make`, `pkg-config`.
* Network libraries: `libpcap-dev`, `libnetfilter-queue-dev` (or equivalent for your OS).
* Python 3.8+ with `pip` and `venv`.
* (Optional) Go, Node.js if you intend to use those API implementations.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd stealth
    ```
2.  **Run the installer script:**
    The installer will attempt to install system dependencies, build C/C++ modules, set up the Python environment, and link the CLI.
    ```bash
    cd installer
    sudo bash ./install_stealth.sh
    ```
    Refer to `installer/post_install.md` for more details and troubleshooting.

### Basic Usage

After installation, the `stealth` command should be available globally.

* **Show help:**
    ```bash
    stealth -h
    ```
* **Start Stealth with IP morphing every 60 seconds and launch the API:**
    ```bash
    sudo stealth -t 60 --api
    ```
    *(Note: `sudo` might be required for network operations, depending on system configuration and how core components are executed).*

* **Start in Ghost Mode (no logging), IP change every 30 seconds:**
    ```bash
    sudo stealth --ghost -t 30
    ```
* **Check current status (if running or to see default config):**
    ```bash
    stealth -s
    ```
* **Launch the Terminal UI (run in a separate terminal if Stealth core is running as a daemon):**
    Assuming the Python virtual environment is `stealth_env` in the project root:
    ```bash
    source stealth_env/bin/activate
    python ui/python/terminal_ui.py
    ```
    Or, if `stealth.sh` is adapted to launch it directly under certain conditions.

### API Interaction

If the API is launched (e.g., with `stealth --api`), you can interact with it (default port 8080):

* **Get status:**
    ```bash
    curl -H "X-Stealth-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" http://localhost:8080/api/v1/status
    ```
    *(Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the actual key, which should be set via the `STEALTH_API_KEY` environment variable for the API process).*

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Building Core Modules Manually

1.  Navigate to `core/cpp/`.
2.  Create a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`.
3.  Run CMake: `cmake ..`.
4.  Compile: `make`.
    Executables (if any are defined as such beyond libraries) will typically be in `core/cpp/build/bin/` or the build root.

### Running Python Components

* **API Server (FastAPI):**
    ```bash
    # Ensure STEALTH_API_KEY is set
    # export STEALTH_API_KEY="your_dev_key"
    source stealth_env/bin/activate
    python -m stealth.api.python.app
    # or: uvicorn stealth.api.python.app:app --reload --port 8080
    ```
* **Terminal UI:**
    ```bash
    source stealth_env/bin/activate
    python ui/python/terminal_ui.py
    ```

### Logging

* **Text logs:** `logs/stealth.log`
* **JSON logs:** `logs/stealth.json`
* The `logging/json_logger.py` script can be used directly to add entries to the JSON log:
    ```bash
    python logging/json_logger.py INFO "Manual test log" component=manual_test
    ```

## üß™ Testing

A basic test suite structure is provided in the `tests/` directory.

* **Core (C/C++):** Placeholder for CTest or GoogleTest in `tests/core/`.
* **API (Python):** Placeholder for Pytest in `tests/api/python/`.
* **CLI (Bash):** Placeholder for Bats tests in `tests/cli/`.

Run tests according to the framework used for each component.
